# final-project
For final, I did the home page of my personal website.

# process
I started with following an youtube video[1] to create the frame of the html and css. After adjusting the margin and font size, I put my music in it and made a hover.

# Problems 
The biggest problem was nested, it also caused my css file unable to link with html file at first.
Then are the margin and the font size, the nested and order also caused the letters moved the way that I don't want.

I kind of spend a lot of time to go over other people's code to see if there was something I did wrong, I also asked my programmer friends to help me cause I can't figure them out.

The code that I used is in citation.
